# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Jesus Robles**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added Party Size feature with stepper to split bill
- [X] Set up background color and emphasized font sizes

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I encountered multiple challenges while completing this project. One challenge was a thread break bug that always happened when I added a navigation controller and included Settings. I was not able to find a clear solution towards that. This did allow me to explore more features which I am excited to implement later on. I look forward to learning more.
